## Introduction

This project implements a high-performance HTTP/2 server with advanced load balancing capabilities using Node.js and TypeScript. It's designed to handle high-traffic scenarios, providing features like session management, rate limiting, and caching to ensure optimal performance and security.
Features

HTTP/2 support with secure HTTPS connections
Advanced load balancing with multiple algorithms:

1. Round-robin
2. Least connections
3. Weighted round-robin
4. IP hash
5. Least response time
6. Consistent hashing


Session management
Rate limiting
In-memory caching
Custom request handling
Health checks for backend servers
Metrics collection and reporting

Project Structure
The project consists of several TypeScript files, each responsible for a specific functionality:

http2Server.ts: Main server implementation
loadBalancer.ts: Load balancing logic
sessionManager.ts: Session management
rateLimiter.ts: Rate limiting implementation
caching.ts: In-memory caching
types.ts: TypeScript interfaces and types
example-usage.ts: Example usage of the server

Prerequisites

Node.js (v14.x or later)
TypeScript (v4.x or later)
OpenSSL (for generating SSL certificates)

Installation

Clone the repository:
Copygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/http2-load-balancer.git
cd http2-load-balancer

Install dependencies:
Copynpm install

Generate SSL certificates:
Copyopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=localhost' \
  -keyout server.key -out server.crt


Configuration
The server can be configured using various configuration objects:

ServerConfig: Main server configuration
LoadBalancerConfig: Load balancer settings
SessionConfig: Session management configuration
RateLimitConfig: Rate limiting settings
CacheConfig: Caching configuration

Refer to the example-usage.ts file for configuration examples.
Usage

Set up your configuration in a new TypeScript file (e.g., app.ts).
Import the necessary components and create an instance of HTTP2Server.
Add backend servers using the addBackend method.
Implement your custom request handler using setRequestHandler.
Start the server using the start method.

Example:
typescriptCopyimport { HTTP2Server } from './http2Server';
// ... import other necessary types and configurations

const server = new HTTP2Server(serverConfig, loadBalancerConfig, sessionConfig, rateLimitConfig, cacheConfig);

// Add backends
server.addBackend({ url: 'https://api1.example.com', weight: 1, maxConnections: 100 });
server.addBackend({ url: 'https://api2.example.com', weight: 2, maxConnections: 200 });

// Set custom request handler
server.setRequestHandler(async (stream, headers, payload) => {
  // Implement your request handling logic here
});

// Start the server
server.start();
Run your application:
Copyts-node app.ts
API Endpoints
The server doesn't have predefined endpoints. You need to implement your own endpoints in the custom request handler. The example-usage.ts file demonstrates how to create endpoints for:

/api/users: A GET endpoint that returns a list of users (demonstrates caching)
/api/login: A POST endpoint for user authentication (demonstrates session management)
/api/protected: A GET endpoint that requires authentication (demonstrates using session data)

Advanced Features
Load Balancing
The load balancer supports multiple algorithms. You can choose the algorithm by setting the algorithm property in the LoadBalancerConfig:

'round-robin': Distributes requests evenly across all backends
'least-connections': Sends requests to the backend with the fewest active connections
'weighted-round-robin': Like round-robin, but backends can handle more requests based on their weight
'ip-hash': Consistently maps IP addresses to specific backends
'least-response-time': Sends requests to the backend with the lowest average response time
'consistent-hashing': Provides a consistent mapping of requests to backends, useful for caching scenarios

Session Management
The SessionManager class handles creating, updating, and cleaning up sessions. Sessions are stored in-memory and can be accessed in your request handler.
Rate Limiting
The RateLimiter class provides basic IP-based rate limiting. You can configure the time window and maximum number of requests allowed per IP address.
Caching
The CacheManager class provides in-memory caching of responses. You can configure which responses should be cached in your custom request handler.
Monitoring and Metrics
The server provides basic metrics through the getMetrics method. You can periodically call this method to log or expose metrics about your server's performance.
Security Considerations

Always use HTTPS in production environments.
Keep your SSL certificates secure and up-to-date.
Implement proper authentication and authorization in your application logic.
Regularly update dependencies to patch any security vulnerabilities.
Consider implementing additional security headers (e.g., HSTS, CSP) in your responses.

Future Enhancements

Implement WebSocket support
Add support for external caching systems (e.g., Redis)
Implement circuit breaker pattern for better fault tolerance
Add support for dynamic backend configuration updates
Implement more comprehensive logging and tracing
